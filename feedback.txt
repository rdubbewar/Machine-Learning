Overall, the project does a nice job of defining a problem, collecting relevant data, and comparing possible solutions. Suggestions for improvement:

- Why no neutral label?
- Please see other research papers for how to properly cite references.
- No error analysis or coefficient analysis.
- The training data and validation data were not properly described. Were any Cubs tweets manually labeled for validation?
