## Evaluation

For a baseline, we use a simple positive and negative word counting method to assign sentiment to a given tweet. We use dataset of positive and negative words to classify tweets. In cases when the number of positive and negative words are equal, we assign positive sentiment. Using this baseline model, we would try to achieve most accuracy.
